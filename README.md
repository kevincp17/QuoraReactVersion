# QuoraReactVersion
This project is about a remake of a popular FAQ site, Quora, using ReactJS frontend, NodeJS backend and PostgresSQL database. My objective with this project is to use 
all of what I learned during Fullstack NodeJS bootcamp to improve my skill and learn new stuff while working on this project. You can also download and read 
Readme Progress.docx to see all progress from the first day to current day of development.
